# Library Management System

A Management System to keep track of registered members and books


## Installation 

- Download all files. 

- If you want to use Python3 IDLE to run it, keep all files in the same folder and run it.
  If you want to use VS Code to run it, change the location to wherever your files (books.txt, members.txt) are in library_module.py with respect to the folder / file you have added to your workspace.

- Enjoy!!!
